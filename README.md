This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created it as a repository for the following blog bost:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## To see the SSR-Errors

Build the project

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

then, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/characters](http://localhost:3000/characters) to see the error for the server-side rendered page.

## To fix the errors

See comments in pages/locations.js and pages/characters.js, fix the API calls and you will see the data as described in my blog post.

Have fun experimenting with this!!
